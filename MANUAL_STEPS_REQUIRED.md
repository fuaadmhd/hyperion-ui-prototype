## ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual Step Required

**Action Needed**: Post the comment to PR #2

### Why Manual Posting is Required

The automated agent environment has the following limitations:
- No GitHub API authentication token accessible
- Cannot use `gh` CLI (requires GH_TOKEN)
- Cannot use `git` commands to interact with PRs
- Cannot use `curl` to GitHub API (blocked by DNS proxy)
- Browser automation to GitHub is blocked (ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT)

### How to Post the Comment

#### Option 1: GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)
1. Navigate to: https://github.com/fuaadmhd/hyperion-ui-prototype/pull/2
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page
3. Click in the "Leave a comment" text area
4. Open the file: `PR2_COMMENT.md`
5. Copy the entire contents
6. Paste into the comment field
7. Click "Comment" button

#### Option 2: Using GitHub CLI (if you have access)

# Post the comment using the provided script
